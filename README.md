# FTPS File Download Script

This script demonstrates how to connect to an FTPS server, download a file, and save it locally using the `ftplib` library in Python.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.

## Installation

You can install the required package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ftplib
Usage
Update the Script:

Replace the placeholders in the script with your FTPS server details (server address, port, username, and password).
Run the Script:

python
Kodu kopyala
from ftplib import FTP_TLS

# FTPS server details
ftp_server = "************.cloud.ibm.com"
ftp_port = 990  # Example port number
ftp_username = "************"
ftp_password = "************"

try:
    ftp = FTP_TLS()
    ftp.connect(ftp_server, ftp_port)
    ftp.login(user=ftp_username, passwd=ftp_password)

    print("Connection successful! Connected with FTPS.")

    ftp.prot_p()

    remote_file_name = 'aa.txt'
    local_file_name = 'download.txt'

    with open(local_file_name, 'wb') as local_file:
        ftp.retrbinary('RETR ' + remote_file_name, local_file.write)
    print(f"File '{remote_file_name}' downloaded as '{local_file_name}'.")

    ftp.quit()
    print("FTPS connection closed.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"FTPS connection error: {e}")
Script Explanation:

The script first establishes an FTPS connection to the specified server using the provided credentials.
It then enables secure data transfer with the prot_p() method.
The script downloads a remote file (aa.txt) and saves it locally as download.txt.
Finally, the script closes the FTPS connection.
Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to catch and print any exceptions that occur during the connection or file transfer process.
